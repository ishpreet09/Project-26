
I have had a lot of fun getting to know red velvet. Red velvet is:

*Mild cocoa flavor
*Tangy buttermilk
*Sweet vanilla
*Very buttery

These 4 flavors are essential to the perfect red velvet layer cake. Not only is the flavor outstanding, red velvet cakes texture is worth writing home about. Its dense and soft with a moist and velvety crumb. However, the absolute best part about red velvet cake is the cream cheese frosting. Slathered on thick, my cream cheese frosting recipe is delicately sweet and undeniably creamy.
                  
I use specific ingredients, certain amounts, and unique mixing techniques to produce my best red velvet cake recipe. Begin by whisking the dry ingredients together, then beat together the wet ingredients. We will combine the two, add buttermilk and tint the batter red.
