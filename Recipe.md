
Cake Flour: I highly recommend that you use cake flour. Cake flour is much lighter than all-purpose and the perfect base for a light, soft-crumbed cake texture. Like I mention above, red velvets texture is important to the authenticity of the flavor. You will thank me for the recommendation after you taste how incredibly soft this cake is! Its the texture you find at professional bakeries. If you can not get your hands on cake flour.

Unsweetened Cocoa Powder: 2 Tablespoons is plenty for a little cocoa flavor without overpowering the vanilla and butter flavors.

Butter & Oil: What sets red velvet cake apart from chocolate is its buttery flavor. With only butter, we risk a dry cake. With only oil, we lose the butter flavor and softness that comes with creaming butter & sugar together. So all that is to say, use both butter and oil. Moist texture, soft and cakey texture, buttery flavor. Boom.

Buttermilk: Buttermilk is tangy, creamy, and makes baked goods extremely moist. You can not make delicious red velvet cake without it! Additionally, buttermilk helps activate the baking soda to leaven the cake.

About the food colouring:  Red velvet cake would not be red without food coloring. For natural coloring, use beet powder. If you donot want to use food coloring, leave it out! The cake will have the same flavor and be a lovely shade of cocoa.

My #1 Trick

Whip the egg whites separately, then fold into the batter.

This cake recipe requires 4 large eggs. Separate the eggs before starting. Beat the egg yolks with the wet ingredients, then beat the egg whites into fluffy peaks and fold them in last. Beating the egg whites incorporates air and promises a velvet-rich texture.

Cream Cheese Frosting

In my opinion, cream cheese frosting pairs best with red velvets flavor and this frosting recipe is really simple. You need block-style cream cheese, butter, confectioners sugar, a splash of milk, vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt to offset the sweetness. It glides on seamlessly and is silky smooth. If you are looking to pipe decoration with this cream cheese frosting, chill it in the refrigerator for 20 minutes. This guarantees the creamy frosting will hold its shape.
